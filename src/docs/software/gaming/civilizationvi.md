## Tips & Tricks

### Skip Launcher

The below assumes you have your Steam games installed to the normal location.
If your game is in a different location, you will need to modify your path.

1. In your Steam Library list, right-click on Civilization VI
2. Select **Properties...**
3. On the **GENERAL** tab, select **SET LAUNCH OPTIONS...**
4. Insert the following line as-is, with the quotes and the `%command%`, but
    using your custom path:
    ```
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Base\Binaries\Win64Steam\CivilizationVI_DX12.exe" %command%
    ```
5. Click **OK**
6. Click **CLOSE**
7. Launch Civ VI

The game will now launch directly into the DX12 version, skipping the launcher.
