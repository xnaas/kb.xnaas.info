# UWP Apps

## Resources

* [What's a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide)

## Info

You can see a list of applications by going to `shell:AppsFolder` in the Run dialog.

You can get a list of per-user UWP apps in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages`

You can launch any UWP application with `explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\<ID from above>` from Run dialog. This info can also be taken and added to GOG Galaxy to manually add undetected UWP games.

An example with Minecraft Dungeons: `explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\Microsoft.Lovika_8wekyb3d8bbwe!Game`
