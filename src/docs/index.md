# xnaasKB

## What is xnaasKB?

xnaasKB is simply a wiki I've created to track information and knowledge I've found over the years.

Prior to this, all of my "documentation" existed as bookmarks to [archive.org](https://archive.org) or
[Reddit](https://reddit.com) links, random text files and PDFs across various filesystems, a
[portable DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/install:dokuwiki_on_a_stick) instance, a portable
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repo, and more. I got fed up with the disorganization and
ugliness of my non-solutions.

^I\ do\ also\ still\ have\ quite\ a\ bit\ of\ stuff\ to\ port\ out\ of\ archive.org\ and\ other\ bookmarks\ Somedayâ„¢.^

### mkdocs

xnaasKB is around thanks to:

* [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)
* [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material)
* [pymdown-extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions)

## Why not DokuWiki?

To keep it short: looks ugly, I've had issues with the search indexing, the non-standard
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is awful, and I ~~hate~~ strongly dislike
[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) for my selfhosted applications.

## Why not BookStack?

Another popular wiki solution right now is [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com) and you might be wondering why
I didn't go with that. I considered it for a moment, but my same dislike for [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)
prevailed here. It does look pretty though.

## Why Wiki.js?

Most recently, I actually ported here, to [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), from [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki).

Wiki.js was decent, but it was a bit over-the-top for what I needed and it lacked one key feature I rely on: 
searching the wiki from my Firefox address bar.

## What else?

I don't have much else for you other than to say "I hope some information here proves useful to you" and to provide
you with a picture of my cat, Tux. She's a good bad kitty.
