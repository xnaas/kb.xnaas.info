# What is xnaasKB?

xnaasKB is simply a wiki I've created to track information and knowledge I've found over the years.

Prior to this, all of my "documentation" existed as bookmarks to [archive.org](https://archive.org) or [Reddit](https://reddit.com) links, random text files and PDFs across various filesystems, a [portable DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/install:dokuwiki_on_a_stick) instance, a portable [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repo, and more. I got fed up with the disorganization and ugliness of my non-solutions.

## Why Wiki.js?

There's a [zillion self-hosted wiki solutions](https://www.wikimatrix.org/?filter=download) out there and you might be wondering why I settled on [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/). To keep it short: looks nice, is actively developed, and is widely used.

Yes, v2 isn't fully complete yet, but progress is coming along nicely.

## Why not DokuWiki?

Again, to keep it short: looks ugly, I've had issues with the search indexing, the non-standard [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is awful, and I ~~hate~~ strongly dislike [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP).

## Why not BookStack?

Another popular wiki solution right now is [BookStack](https://www.bookstackapp.com) and you might be wondering why I didn't go with that. I considered it for a moment, but my same dislike for [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP) prevailed here. It does look pretty though.

## What else?

I don't have much else for you other than to say "I hope some information here proves useful to you" and to provide you with a picture of my cat, Tux. She's a good bad kitty.
